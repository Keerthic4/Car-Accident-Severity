# Coursera_Capstone

## Introduction
Every year car accidents cause hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. According to a research conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) there were 1.35 million road tra c deaths globally in 2016, with millions more sustaining serious injuries and living with long-term adverse health consequences. Globally, road tra c crashes are a leading cause of death among young people, and the main cause of death among those aged 15{29 years. Road tra c injuries are currently estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death across all age groups globally, and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030.

For the final capstone project in the IBM certificate course, we want to analyze the accident “severity” in terms of human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of accident bad impact. The data was collected by Seattle SPOT Traffic Management Division and provided by Coursera via a link. This dataset is updated weekly and is from 2004 to present. It contains information such as severity code, address type, location, collision type, weather, road condition, speeding, among others.

The target audiences of this study are those people who really care about the traffic records, especially in the transportation department. Also, we want to figure out the reason for collisions and help to reduce accidents in the future.
